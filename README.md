# CS Independent Study: Classes To Cloud

This repository includes all the worksheets, setup information, and other
resources required to guide learners from the creation of series of simple
Python games all the way up to a full cloud deployment on AWS. The goal is to
provide a way for a motivated student to take some basic Python knowledge and,
with the help of ChatBots, scale up their knowledge.

## Mission

This course provides a motivate student the resources to improve their
understanding of both programming and modern software engineering concepts. The
class expects students to heavily utilize ChatBots and then to solidify their
knowledge with written reflection.

## Navigation

To understand the course, there are four main sections:

- Basic knowledge:
    - [Python](./00_intermediate_python)
    - [Shell](./01_shell)
    - [Git](./git)
- ChatBots and client-side apps
    - [ChatBot Aid](./05_chatbot_aid)
- Cloud-Based Computing
    - [Intro AWS](./06_aws_part_one)
    - [Docker](./07_docker)
    - [Infrastructure as Code](./08_aws_part_two)

## Contributions

Overall, this course is a work in progress (dependent on individual students in
my class showing interest in a particular area) and I am open to any/all
suggestions.
