## Essential Questions

- What is the terminal?
- What does the terminal let us do that we can't do in a GUI?

## Lesson Plan

In this lesson, students are given a fun, easy activity to give them their first
taste of Terminal. They play the "game" GameShell, which has them move about a
digital kingdom, learning terminal commands along the way. The accompanying
worksheet guides them through any difficulties and has them reflect on their
experience.

> TODO: Docker loses all progress when it is exited. Alter GameShell so has passwords
  that allow you to jump to place of last progress (similar to OverTheWire).
