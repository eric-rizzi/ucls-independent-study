## Essential Questions

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- 

### Time Expectations

- A motivated student should finish this in ~150m

### Actual Lesson 

I signed you up for "Grok Learning" at https://groklearning.com . This is
something that you will do when you start 9th grade, but getting started early
will allow you to access more difficult content while other students are working
on the beginning stuff.

This is what I suggest:
1. Do the "Introduction to Programming - Python" lesson I've signed you for up
   to and including lesson 4 (manipulating string)
2. Email me when you finish that lesson and I'll send you your next set of tasks

> A good thing to do before you get started might be to watch the first ~36m or
so of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8&authuser=0).
It'll give you the basics and then you can get started with Grok.

Good luck! My hope is that you see how similar Scratch is to Python and you feel
comfortable making the small changes from thinking about creating programs in
Scratch to creating programs in Python.
