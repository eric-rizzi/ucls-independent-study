## Essential Questions

- How does the debugger work?
- What techniques are most effective for finding logic errors?

## Lesson Plan

In this lesson, students use the debugger to "solve" a murder mystery. In the
process, they learn to read/understand different parts of a paused program's
state. The guiding PRIMM worksheet walks them through all the necessary
information and then has them reflect on their experience.
