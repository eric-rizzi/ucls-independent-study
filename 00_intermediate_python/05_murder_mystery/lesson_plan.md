## Essential Questions

- How does the debugger work?
- What techniques are most effective for finding logic errors?

## Lesson Plan

In this lesson, students use the debugger to "solve" a murder mystery. In the
process, they learn to read/understand different parts of a paused program's
state. The guiding PRIMM worksheet walks them through all the necessary
information and then has them reflect on their experience.

### Setup

- `Murder Mystery Worksheet` loaded into Schoology
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdd0-y73EI7VdYLAwW9pbDehiGE70M0T7hvVsgzJvRA
    - Note: This is a larger, more structured version than the ML/AI murder mystery worksheet

### Time Expectations

- A motivated student should finish this in ~150m
