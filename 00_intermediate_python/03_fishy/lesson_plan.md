Attached is a partially completed version of the game "Fishy". You can see what
it's supposed to eventually look like here. This is what you should do:

1. Download the `Fishy.zip` file attached to this email
2. Unzip `Fishy.zip` and put the resulting `Fishy` folder into a special spot (maybe another folder like `cs_workspace` on your Desktop)
3. Go into the `Fishy` folder and double click on `fishy.code-workspace`
    - This should result in the program `Visual Studio Code` opening with several fishy files for you to read/edit
4. Open the file called `README.md` and read/follow the instructions

Assuming you accomplish all the tasks in `README.md`, you should, in the end,
have a fully working version of Fishy. Just be aware that this is a bit harder
than the pong game, so it might take several days to get it all working.

As always, let me know if you have any questions and let me know if/when you finish.
