Attached is a partially completed version of the classic game "Pong". This is what you should do:

1. Follow [these instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk7TG5BqxjY) to install `vscode` on your computer
2. Download the `Pong.zip` file attached to this email
3. Unzip `Pong.zip` and put the resulting `Pong` folder into a special spot (maybe another folder like `cs_workspace` on your Desktop)
4. Go into the `Pong` folder and double click on `pong.code-workspace`
    - This should result in the program `Visual Studio Code` opening with several pong files for you to read/edit
5. Open the file called `README.md` and read/follow the instructions

Assuming you accomplish all the tasks in `README.md`, you should, in the end, have a fully working version of Pong.

As always, let me know if you have any questions and let me know if/when you finish.

PS. Note that `vscode` is a very powerful code editor that we use in 9th grade
AND that I used at my old job. If you get a bit confused by it, I'd suggest
watching a few youtube videos to see what it's capable of/how it works.
